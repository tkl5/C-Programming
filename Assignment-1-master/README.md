A gnome sort for sort1, and a bubble sort for sort2.

The gnome sort works similarly to insertion sort, except that moving an element to its proper place is done by a series of swaps.

Bubble sort works by comparing each pair of adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed.

Compilation times:

sort1 took 12889 ms
sort2 took 45054 ms
